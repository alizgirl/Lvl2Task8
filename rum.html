            Rum is a liquor made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice. The distillate, a clear liquid, 
            is often aged in oak barrels. Rum is produced in nearly every sugar-producing region of the world, such as the Philippines, where 
            Tanduay is the largest producer of rum globally.[1][2][3]
            <br>
            <br>
            Rums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas "golden" and "dark" rums were typically 
            consumed straight or neat, iced ("on the rocks"), or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are 
            made to be consumed either straight or iced.

            Rum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland, in Canada. 
            The beverage has associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was 
            consumed as bumbo). Rum has also served as a medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery (see Triangular
             trade), organized crime, and military insurgencies (e.g., the American Revolution and Australia's Rum Rebellion).</p>

            <h2>Daiquiri</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Daiquirí is also the name of a beach and an iron mine near Santiago de Cuba, and is a word of Taíno origin.[1] 
                The drink was supposedly invented by an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox, who was in Cuba (then at the tail-end 
                of the Spanish Captaincy-General government) at the time of the Spanish–American War. It is also possible that William A. 
                Chanler, a US congressman who purchased the Santiago iron mines in 1902, introduced the daiquiri to clubs in New York in 
                that year.[2]: 168 
                <br>
                <br>
                Originally the drink was served in a tall glass packed with cracked ice. A teaspoon of sugar was poured over the ice, and 
                the juice of one or two limes was squeezed over the sugar. Two or three ounces of white rum completed the mixture. The glass 
                was then frosted with a long-handled spoon. Later the daiquiri evolved to be mixed in a shaker with the same ingredients but 
                with shaved ice. After a thorough shaking, it was poured into a chilled coupe glass.
                <br>
                <br>
                Consumption of the drink remained localized until 1909, when Rear Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, a U.S. Navy medical officer, 
                tried Cox's drink. Johnson subsequently introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C., and drinkers of the daiquiri 
                increased over the space of a few decades. It was one of the favorite drinks of the writer Ernest Hemingway and U.S. President 
                John F. Kennedy.[3]
                <br>
                <br>
                The drink became popular in the 1940s.[citation needed] World War II rationing made whiskey and vodka hard to come by, 
                yet rum was easily obtainable owing[citation needed] to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy, which 
                opened up trade and travel relations with Latin America, Cuba, and the Caribbean. The Good Neighbor policy, also known as the 
                Pan-American program, helped make Latin America fashionable.[according to whom?] Consequently, rum-based drinks (once frowned 
                upon as the choice of sailors and down-and-outs) also became fashionable, and the daiquiri saw tremendous popularity in the US.
                <br>
                <br>
                The basic recipe for a daiquiri is also similar to the grog British sailors drank aboard ships from the 1780s as a means
                 of preventing scurvy. By 1795 the Royal Navy daily grog ration contained rum, water, ¾ ounce of lemon or lime juice, and 
                 2 ounces of sugar.[4] This was a common drink across the Caribbean, and as soon as ice became available this was included
                  instead of the water.
