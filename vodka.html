        <p class="col-md-5" id="vodkaAbout">Vodka (Polish: wódka [ˈvutka], Russian: водка [ˈvotkə], Swedish: vodka [vɔdkɑː]) is a clear distilled alcoholic 
            beverage. Different varieties originated in Poland, Russia, and Sweden.[1][2] Vodka is composed mainly of water and ethanol but 
            sometimes with traces of impurities and flavourings.[3] Traditionally, it is made by distilling liquid from fermented cereal grains, 
            and potatoes since introduced in Europe in the 1700's. Some modern brands use corn, sugar cane, fruits, honey, and maple sap as the 
            base.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the 1890s, standard vodkas have been 40% alcohol by volume (ABV) (80 U.S. proof).[4] The European Union has established a 
            minimum alcohol content of 37.5% for vodka.[5][6] Vodka in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%.[7]
            <br>
            <br>
            Vodka is traditionally drunk "neat" (not mixed with water, ice, or other mixers), and it is often served freezer chilled in the 
            vodka belt of Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, and Ukraine.[3] It is also 
            used in cocktails and mixed drinks, such as the vodka martini, Cosmopolitan, vodka tonic, screwdriver, greyhound, Black or White
            Russian, Moscow mule, Bloody Mary, and Caesar.

            <h2>Cosmopolitan</h2>
            <br>
            <p id="cosmo">
                The International Bartenders Association recipe is based on vodka citron, lemon-flavored vodka.[1] The cosmopolitan is a 
                relative of cranberry coolers like the Cape Codder.[2] Though often presented far differently, the cosmopolitan also bears a
                 likeness in composition to the kamikaze cocktail. The origin of the cosmopolitan is disputed.[3]
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The 1930s</b>
                <br>
                While the cocktail is widely perceived to be a more modern creation, there is a recipe for a Cosmopolitan Daisy which appears 
                in Pioneers of Mixing at Elite Bars 1903–1933, published in 1934.
                <br>
                <br>
                Jigger of Gordon's Gin (1+1⁄2 US fl oz [4.4 cl] Beefeater)
                2 dash Cointreau (1⁄2 US fl oz [1.5 cl] Cointreau)
                Juice of 1 Lemon (1 US fl oz [3.0 cl] Lemon Juice)
                1 tsp [.5 cl] Raspberry Syrup (homemade)
                <br>
                <br>
                Shake with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.
                <br>
                <br>
                Made with ingredients that would have been readily available during the period, this identically named cocktail aims for 
                the same effect. If this drink is in fact the source of the modern cosmopolitan, then it would be an adaption of a Daisy rather 
                than a Kamikaze.[4][5][6][7]
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Provincetown</b>
                <br>
                One version of the creation of this popular drink credits the accomplishment to the gay community in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Neal Murray</b>
                <br>
                Bartender Neal Murray says he created the cosmopolitan in 1975 at the Cork & Cleaver steak house in Minneapolis.[8] According to 
                Murray, he added a splash of cranberry juice to a Kamikaze and the first taster declared, "How cosmopolitan."[8] Murray's 
                Cosmopolitan used 1.5 oz Gordon's vodka, .75 oz Rose's Lime, .75 oz Leroux triple sec, and .5 oz cranberry juice.[9]

                <b>John Caine</b>
                <br>
                John Caine is the owner of several popular bars in San Francisco and a cosmopolitan expert. He partially credits the upsurge in 
                cocktails during the 1970s to the Cosmo being served at fern bars.[3] Caine is credited with bringing the Cosmo west from 
                Cleveland.[10]
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Cheryl Cook</b>
                <br>
                There are a number of other claims made as to the origin of the cosmopolitan. Cocktail historian Gary Regan credits bartender 
                Cheryl Cook of the Strand Restaurant in South Beach, Florida with the original creation.[2][3] In a letter to Regan, Cook related 
                the story of how she created the drink in 1985 or 1986:[11]
                <br>
                <br>
                <q>What overwhelmed me was the number of people who ordered Martinis just to be seen with a Martini glass in their hand. It was
                 on this realization that gave me the idea to create a drink that everyone could palate and was visually stunning in that classic
                  glass. This is what the Cosmo was based on.</q>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                Cook's original recipes called for "Absolut Citron, a splash of Triple sec, a drop of Rose's lime and just enough cranberry to 
                make it oh so pretty in pink."[11] Although Absolut Citron was not introduced anywhere officially until 1988, it was test marketed 
                in Miami.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Melissa Huffsmith-Roth</b>
                <br>
                Notable bartender Gaz Regan says that the internationally recognized version of the cocktail was created by Toby Cecchini & 
                Melissa Huffsmith-Roth in 1989 at the Odeon restaurant in Manhattan based on a poorly described version of Cheryl Cook's creation.
                [11] Huffsmith-Roth's Cosmopolitan includes 2 oz Absolut Citron vodka, 1 oz Cointreau, 1 oz lime juice, and .5 oz cranberry 
                juice.[9]
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>New York City</b>
                <br>
                According to Sally Ann Berk and Bob Sennett, the cosmopolitan appears in literature as early as 1993 and derives from New York
                 City.[12][13][14][15] However, a bartender named Patrick "Paddy" Mitten is also credited with bringing the drink to New York City 
                 from San Francisco in October 1987.
